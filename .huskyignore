# Husky Ignore Configuration
# This file specifies which files/patterns should skip git hooks

# Release-related commits (when HUSKY=0 is set)
# - Version bump commits
# - Changelog updates
# - Tag creation

# You can also disable Husky per command:
# HUSKY=0 git commit -m "release: v1.0.0"
# git commit --no-verify -m "release: v1.0.0"

# Or use our release scripts which handle this automatically:
# bun run release:patch  (skips hooks by default)
# bun run release:patch:no-hooks  (includes hooks)
